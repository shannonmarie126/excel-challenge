3 conclusions :
1.	The theater parent category had the most number of campaigns overall (not in CH or GB though), while journalism had the least amount overall (and in all countries). 
2.	The Play Subcategory had the highest number of campaigns overall and in every country. 
3.	Overall, there were more successful campaigns in the summer, cancelled counts are relatively consistent every month and while failed varies more than cancelled, it appears to be relatively consistent as well. 

Limitations
1.	Some parent categories (like theater) only had one subcategory, while other parent categories were split into multiple subcategories, giving the data of those not split more weight in the chart organized by sub category.
2.	The stacked column chart does not include percentages to make easier comparisons between categories based off success/failure rates. 
3.	This is raw data that has not been manipulated/normalized for comparison. 

Other possible tables/graphs and additional value 
1.	A chart with percent successful that can be filtered by category and country. 
2.	Pie chart of successful campaigns split up by category and filterable by country. 

Mean or Median
	Median, both successful and failed have large standard deviations suggesting the data is very spread out and the mean is influenced by outliers and the median is not influenced by outliers. 
Variability
	Both values have high variability, but the successful campaigns have higher variability than the failed ones suggesting failed campaigns backer count is more centered on a mean and a count close to the mean is more predictive of the result. This makes sense as successful campaigns could have one or two large backers and still be successful or many small ones, creating more variance.
